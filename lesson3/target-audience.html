        <p class="audience">
          Our target audiences are both male and female who are looking for the
          information of local weather, news, and events. Their age varies; from teens to
          in their 70s. They simply like to make a plan in advance so that they could
          relax right before their plans. They dislike the last minute hassle for any
          occasion. They also would like to feel that they are a part of a community of
          Eastern Idaho; hence finding the local news and events is a high priority for
          them. Some of them are photo enthusiast who love sharing their works and looking
          at beautiful pictures in general. They need to know about the information of
          weather and temperature before leaving for their outdoor photo shoot.
